# Vercel Deployment Guide for Schulen App

This guide will help you deploy your React application to Vercel successfully.

## Prerequisites

1. A Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
2. Git repository with your React application

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Application

Ensure your application has the following files properly configured:

- `vercel.json` - Contains the Vercel-specific configuration
- `.env` - Contains environment variables
- `package.json` - Contains the correct build scripts

### 2. Deploy Using the Vercel Dashboard

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Click "Import Project" or "New Project"
3. Select "Import Git Repository"
4. Connect your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account if not already connected
5. Select the repository containing your React application
6. Configure the project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Select "Create React App"
   - **Build Command**: Leave as default (Vercel will use the `vercel-build` script)
   - **Output Directory**: Leave as default (`build`)
   - **Environment Variables**: Add any necessary environment variables
7. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Deploy Using the Vercel CLI

Alternatively, you can deploy using the Vercel CLI:

1. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Log in to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel login
   ```

3. Navigate to your project directory and deploy:
   ```
   cd schulen_app
   vercel
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to configure your deployment

### 4. Troubleshooting

If you encounter a 404 NOT_FOUND error:

1. Ensure your `vercel.json` file is correctly configured with the rewrites section
2. Check that your React Router is properly set up
3. Verify that the build process completed successfully in the Vercel deployment logs
4. Try clearing the Vercel cache and redeploying

### 5. Verifying Deployment

After deployment, Vercel will provide you with a URL to access your application. Visit this URL to ensure your application is working correctly.
