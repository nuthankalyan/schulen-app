# Troubleshooting Blog Publishing Issues

Follow these steps to solve the error when publishing blogs:

## 1. Make sure the server is running

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd schulen_app/server

# Start the server
npm start
```

You should see "Server running on port 5000" and "Connected to MongoDB Atlas" messages.

## 2. Check the .env file

Make sure you have a `.env` file in the `schulen_app/server` directory with the following variables:

```
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

Note: Replace the placeholder values with real ones.

## 3. Check your MongoDB connection

If you don't have MongoDB Atlas set up:
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create a free account
2. Create a new cluster
3. Get the connection string and update your `.env` file

## 4. Check if you are logged in

The blog endpoint requires authentication:
1. Make sure you are logged in
2. Check the localStorage 'token' value is present

## 5. Check browser console for errors

The enhanced error messages should provide more details.

## 6. Try using a fresh token

If your token has expired:
1. Log out
2. Log back in to get a new token

## 7. Check server logs

The server now has detailed logging. Look for any error messages when you try to publish a blog.

## 8. CORS issues

If you're seeing CORS errors:
1. The server is configured to allow all origins for testing
2. Make sure you're using 'http://localhost:5000' as the server URL
